ec6da569-65de-4377-96e1-dc2ce37e7e3f 7142 linux-dev meta Jermaine, RTM
77641dbd-6c19-4a8f-95bc-2cc524318968 7148 linux-dev meta it tells you
632095c7-e34b-47ee-9cc2-fa272aef3932 7157 linux-dev jetta Santo: that requires running OS X
363375bf-44d1-436a-a930-a3c91149a7e0 7169 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: If running as root, I need to set up a global config rather than ~/.fetchmailrc ?
7e7035dc-b730-4292-be06-830e50eadea2 7173 linux-dev kathie Jermaine:  date '+%m%d%Y'
45c48784-2502-494a-910c-854aa068d33b 7183 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: yup
a0a09784-28e9-40a7-9e03-47e50d4d164a 7190 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: I run it in daemon mode under my uid and it works very nicely

fc5a3eda-e484-4513-998a-9cf8eb8006aa 7200 linux-dev rachel pretty much put same info in global location.
1737c67f-57a8-46eb-947b-3fbeabe9ed66 7215 linux-dev shanon epic5 is pretty cool...
4ef06f53-be1d-4f11-954a-7ae4e87806f0 7236 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: OK thanks.. I'll try to find the docs on that.
5eb61d50-edd4-4845-b95b-f34182d87817 7238 linux-dev elma hi folks
9bbcc193-a0c5-4cf5-a495-bc3d2b95c641 7260 linux-dev elma 'm sure i missed something but fonts rendering in my gimp works isn't at its best
98487fa2-7a0d-4632-b8df-010757d2d229 7287 linux-dev elma is it because f the gimp or have i missed some tuning or such?
80595b32-8afe-4ea8-9e73-20d61d81b64a 7288 linux-dev sena is there anyway to see what the CPU temperature is ?
402bf638-7215-4af2-a93b-7b16b099e21c 7296 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: use "/etc/fetchmailrc"        -f <pathname> | --fetchmailrc <pathname>
a80df85e-a099-480e-ae65-26ad9de723e5 7297 linux-dev rachel Specify  a non-default name for the ~/.fetchmailrc run control file.
74015c8d-dc47-413e-984a-af1488d60513 7312 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: in the man page http://fetchmail.berlios.de/fetchmail-man.html it doesn't mention any global fetchmailrc file... that is what was confusing me...
b0becb8d-9496-49b2-84cc-0affdf5bd5e6 7322 linux-dev thurman hi, do you have any recommendations for saving videos from a webcam in GNU/Linux?
d43ff790-63da-4680-a18f-9ab080b2bf2d 7335 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
c3413d40-0897-4a6a-870a-af90decebef9 7341 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it.  And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)
aa7e35be-2338-4d0f-a56c-9546a0aa9feb 7373 linux-dev meta Thurman, try motion
a6ed7e01-1ed5-485a-81ae-4b1ef332b7c6 7379 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: hmm
315e18a0-d5ac-404f-a42c-8a4c98ce2ea8 7503 linux-dev thurman Meta: isn't it strange that it writes to /var/lib/motion/snapshots
486007f9-ae8a-4cfd-b793-cd24f46c1d91 7511 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: ok my bad.. the /etc/init.d script exits automatically (and silently.. bitches) if no /etc/fetchmailrc exists
369afa62-ac18-4873-b3f5-e6ff6eee3401 7528 linux-dev malcolm have these people never heard of error messages?
d93b8dad-eade-4a33-8623-4e3d746c3197 7533 linux-dev jesse Malcolm: it runs as user fetchmail here, and uses /etc/fetchmailrc
9e0ec7f2-e05c-4d59-8017-a0cf8374fbb4 7548 linux-dev malcolm Jesse: thanks
791a41f5-0798-4b8c-becf-ebb461861ce0 7561 linux-dev malcolm Jesse: set up to do the same here, looks like

142f6dd6-5bab-482b-b054-b195cc4eac5b 7573 linux-dev rachel Jesse++
096ddc8c-125f-4e9e-aad9-b948e8192a7d 7638 linux-dev denny so how does one enforce a permission set and ownership set on a folder and all its children?

b976a757-4f6f-4b5a-bc34-db0dcf630346 7756 linux-dev elma well... have a nice day folks
7bb8ee3a-c69b-4ade-a5c9-fda25a855e30 7783 linux-dev shenna hi, are sata drives accessed as sda or hda?
39ebc16e-c48f-469c-9dd3-bd487069f1a6 7796 linux-dev elma sda
73ee61ac-2e04-4ab5-af9a-58787b51e96d 7860 linux-dev johnathon hey wat's up ?
acb8da32-b194-4275-8420-7b91b26f74c0 7885 linux-dev shenna Elma: , then why is it that my 2.4 kernel recognises it as hda?
e60ebba5-82b2-439e-a8d6-94aa085664a4 7898 linux-dev denny Elma, no I mean like always
c0d04fa1-c12b-424b-b67d-3fadf289e976 7904 linux-dev denny so if anything is added to that folder
08da0e12-ffac-45de-8bf5-8d3b931d5217 7919 linux-dev denny the permission and ownership stays the same
7c5bd6aa-fd0a-45ff-af6a-05846722ad79 7954 linux-dev denny throughout
36063401-ba42-4a48-a203-734be6d4bce6 7972 linux-dev latricia is there a way to tail -f a file and have that output piped to sed to have certain lines colorized?
d8ee594e-9199-43aa-b402-ad6f017970f8 8001 linux-dev malcolm Rachel / Jesse: should i put the "set daemon" option in /etc/fetchmailrc ? I'm guessing not
e26b46b8-0286-4994-b7b8-f0dfa108ee4b 8020 linux-dev shenna even dmesg says "hda:...."
901f7c18-beb0-401e-b02b-3af306f7947f 8025 linux-dev shenna why is it so?
b108164b-1a4b-419f-b78f-be539f0dd7bb 8029 linux-dev elma bye folks

2d3abf7e-cad5-40ea-8506-e5da6d9903d7 8060 linux-dev shenna i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
2597cdb8-a966-4b9e-a2d8-5bb11561ab1e 8063 linux-dev melda Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
ab14fa7a-a554-4d28-ab10-4110219954b0 8075 linux-dev tammi hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?

d047d922-da9f-4e68-ba69-20d696bec75e 9150 linux-dev arlie gah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
71f8ffc1-0e33-4a6e-adf4-34ad8edc9216 9186 linux-dev shenna Arlie: what happened?
477d7106-f582-4fba-9538-a4671ecf4243 9200 linux-dev jetta I would like to make linux bootable on my intel mac mini.  Can anyone help me out with some info on getting around all the EFI nonsense?
f46a409e-041e-4819-bea1-efa488c91aee 9214 linux-dev gale Shenna: yeah, I would go with 2.6.21 unless your distro is good about backporting security
b6871777-f60d-4639-8ea2-5f363712ccfe 9215 linux-dev arlie Shenna, another jerk wrote horrible code and unleashed it on the planet
0d9b6295-7a72-47a7-a710-a22966d84db8 9245 linux-dev margene that was me sorry
2208ccd2-f40a-4757-848c-52535919aa8f 9266 linux-dev shenna Gale: what do ou mean?
09ace1b0-8d3e-4d07-9d2f-833a494a0e25 9347 linux-dev gale Shenna: there's some security advisory up to version 2.6.20.8 afaik.  Guess what, if you use say 2.6.20.1, for instance, and your distro didn't address those vulnerabilities in their older version of the kernel, you're vulnerable.
4a12f576-9e79-42c9-9dd1-47c454e4f251 9377 linux-dev shenna i downloaded the source today
282aed1e-773f-42d9-bc07-4ddb93ccb9db 9383 linux-dev margene the top distros usually do
efd7aad6-9e75-4cc5-9821-1c3250abaa52 9390 linux-dev shenna so i guess it is the correct one

(redhat specifically, but I'd be happier with something that works on most linuxes, rather than something redhat-specific)
94723003-65d1-4bf0-bb6e-17bdeda581f3 10058 linux-dev maegan I know it's not the leetest question in the word, but how do I remove those little bars that appear next to applets on the kde taskbar?

15512a14-45bd-4029-a983-2195feb80d0f 10190 linux-dev jana Margarette: your question is vague, I can't quite tell what you're asking, but at first pass it looks like the answer is "you can't".

a6d9d49e-5779-4b96-863f-7f15a76530dd 10469 linux-dev gale German: ok, but each installation is like one more foot in the grave for it due to the dumbest thing every created -- the registry

efef508c-c0d4-4e83-a510-4bfd76b39f55 12027 linux-dev gale Ruthe: did you try /etc/init.d/networking restart?

6019932f-a74c-4b29-8b65-3c4bae8f31bb 12127 linux-dev ruthe so at least Im sure he knows how to do that much
eaa03dff-7580-471f-b0cb-e7917a75503f 12130 linux-dev angla is there another cable to try ?
221ff5c3-97e1-426e-8608-77bb5d5d6cf5 12141 linux-dev gale has he plugged in a power cable before though?
b7a0bf52-4083-43b1-aacf-5d622f0ae43c 12152 linux-dev ruthe there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?
c3c8bcf4-c190-4c7c-a92e-52ffb6b2d507 12156 linux-dev albertine is starting to hate his custom kernel
fa467814-9e0f-4f24-bbf5-92bd9bfc2fb9 12169 linux-dev leota but i do love kde 3.5.7 :D
451da8d2-1fa4-4562-947f-8c864f76bc09 12189 linux-dev ruthe Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on
c710e1f9-d872-4e41-ba72-04865a8a07ff 12193 linux-dev angla Ruthe, trying as many possibilities as possible. it's *bound* to be something simple
dc5f7023-054f-43bd-9a7e-c3d9a98e06a7 12240 linux-dev renate Leota, what's new in it compared to 3.5.6? lol
53dd9105-d411-46e2-89ef-bf147ccb8769 12276 linux-dev gale Ruthe: did you make sure the network module is loaded?
cb4227c4-3bd7-4866-9526-c493088defdb 12281 linux-dev leota Renate: you get custom text colour for kicker, so you can have a black background in kicker with nice white text or whatever colour you want
bca96c30-d28c-40f7-8ee3-972266cc7a0d 12295 linux-dev renate oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then
569ac8d9-f41f-4eb8-8a34-a65ed006da0c 12299 linux-dev leota and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit
f07fb9ff-270c-442f-8d40-4c0ca7c4b9a0 12338 linux-dev margene the kicker is the kicker
8b6de846-edf2-45ca-ba76-34b7f0551504 12348 linux-dev angla Ruthe, if i were you, i'd make a list of possible reasons why. and then systematically try them out. i wouldn't go assuming anything
54698f16-6d9d-48ac-9470-cd0f18d2304d 12377 linux-dev jeanice you need a custom kernel for kde?
dcb9d46e-c26d-455d-b95a-88f8be44b13c 12377 linux-dev gale yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
0a967fed-d1d7-454e-a2b9-2b1c054a6594 12397 linux-dev gale best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
da56cb22-b0d8-4f59-b073-55df854aefc8 12397 linux-dev leota Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
9abcd303-c1de-461e-a453-6f34e479607e 12418 linux-dev leota Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
056c194b-b040-4e22-b61f-32638c3f998c 12425 linux-dev margene I'll just wait for kde 4
d5fe23a6-882e-4d3c-be9a-702caf5a8c91 12427 linux-dev leota and i wanted initng
aaf3f8fb-ecf8-4efc-8e4e-ca8ac6d40c43 12432 linux-dev leota Margene: long wait then...
a59ee67d-2de4-4c72-a4e0-8bc64d4484ab 12434 linux-dev margene till then I'll stick w/ xfce
7999ea4e-0156-4ab6-a04c-715d069632e6 12435 linux-dev angla the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
fd1336c9-cea1-4b92-a2bd-ca72bb759b66 12439 linux-dev renate KDE4 is vaporware...
558fe6eb-2eed-48b2-b394-8e189643d1b5 12445 linux-dev jeanice Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
7a74f775-e7ea-4725-8525-4749a849400c 12463 linux-dev margene indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
882146bd-754f-4364-aa7a-4ab27c938dc6 12463 linux-dev santo Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware?  Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
0ae013b7-9241-43fc-82f5-110938b3ccf0 12476 linux-dev margene Santo, not go, but try it out
99baa293-9226-4384-9004-899d6d2471ad 12481 linux-dev santo ah
695f17fd-0da1-4f47-ab9e-6ef1a9f1896b 12499 linux-dev gale Angla: or like I always say, "
5b0f41e1-b84f-44d5-ac68-55edae22d63c 12511 linux-dev angla ?
05f8d334-8d7b-4ac1-b2f0-ef079438f9a4 12512 linux-dev margene the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
a3363071-da16-4fe5-ac8a-765231debddb 12513 linux-dev gale When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
8916f9cd-d738-44ec-b172-4d320658752d 12523 linux-dev christina I have a question.  I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.
7e24561b-810a-4df4-90f3-7b799f035400 12537 linux-dev delmar has anyone used  Xcircuit ?  is that an app to draw and to test circiuts if theu work ?
65f9a6b5-b584-4c14-9f72-5a8dde05427f 12571 linux-dev angla Gale, a calm methodical approach to narrowing the search space, then you shoot the dog that chewed the cable ...
bb6d82a1-b0ad-4143-b46b-244b905d6210 12588 linux-dev margene for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
04bc4ded-8901-4596-b468-3f2da71d054b 12588 linux-dev leota Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
f3791f5a-e9a4-4ceb-b6b0-c48653703935 12598 linux-dev jeanice Leota: what went wrong?
10998dd7-a7fe-46da-95e9-20896a4ed2a4 12614 linux-dev leota Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
bb121dd5-a3d6-49de-a271-098eebbef36c 12614 linux-dev gale yeah, being methodical is a big part
c295acf0-39eb-4f23-9fbd-755957611a1c 12650 linux-dev jeanice Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
4d233550-9a5a-4e9a-84ee-79aa6a10116c 12711 linux-dev renate I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
80c12f50-9446-4b73-b68e-09a8155560e5 12719 linux-dev renate then again, d4x is kinda broken too
6297a9a6-9861-40a8-af71-b2d7f0083b0a 12735 linux-dev margene I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
f17d2794-98e9-4d90-afd9-fb4ecefce149 12742 linux-dev leota Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
59e54e67-4354-415c-b118-5148d9c13dbd 12743 linux-dev margene nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
e2e3a9ba-df7c-48cc-bc1d-998e86f432a6 12766 linux-dev gertrud ok i have an ext3 image
65e14b30-72f4-4ae3-ae71-91a244f174a9 12776 linux-dev renate Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
de00fb62-b312-481d-9099-f7dc983b2430 12776 linux-dev gertrud i did not unmount it cleanly

e95193f2-9590-4f55-b90c-9d7f0f92b7f0 12784 linux-dev gertrud is there a way to fsck an image?
f581b633-8d23-4d89-be4c-998ae6549be1 12795 linux-dev gertrud it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
5f875350-3e72-49c3-a781-36fddd18c5a6 12797 linux-dev margene archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
d628cc90-ff22-40bf-bf04-5be488dad651 12805 linux-dev jeanice Leota: what distro?
934a8567-2277-4d80-8473-a667f43635b9 12813 linux-dev gertrud its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
902f5984-c38b-4a4b-bbf4-669235f6573c 12818 linux-dev angla downthemall works for me
7f2a2ef1-9168-4fa5-85af-3e35f8e25859 12831 linux-dev renate Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
1a14bf3e-f581-4518-a594-b1bf68f6d6af 12841 linux-dev renate (scripting)
2ad5afd0-1072-4fcb-8dae-86802a0e214d 12884 linux-dev margene well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms
d4e9019c-04b0-46e6-81c1-cff77f90750f 12907 linux-dev renate Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
579c2423-a43c-4015-8739-fca1006009eb 12923 linux-dev margene no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
7ce11baf-109d-457c-b08a-c989e5af7c47 12934 linux-dev leota Jeanice: kubuntu
5786a8a0-bcdc-4607-879d-9991576264a1 12949 linux-dev arlie posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
3ac6acf2-02b3-48ec-9547-dab0cb09969a 12956 linux-dev margene I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
4426717a-dd56-4c1a-bb03-9d31ebb624c1 12980 linux-dev julietta can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?

8b8db47f-4396-47fa-b904-553dea558c86 13004 linux-dev arlie so yes
05885a15-a127-4056-bdc9-11e6bbec1217 13010 linux-dev arlie they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
7ecc866d-7fb7-48cd-bf57-7c4f636ccf73 13011 linux-dev renate Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
df4bd53e-b37f-4c8f-b5dc-8abdb3e9987a 13022 linux-dev jeanice Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
4343852d-bc8a-47cc-bc6d-e0aba4a21516 13026 linux-dev margene Renate, I dunno, it just happens
07769291-9d28-44e4-ba00-99e39f518101 13041 linux-dev renate magic, zomg! :o.O
031327c0-21f0-4849-823a-a5f3dcb57856 13047 linux-dev margene you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
d1eb5b23-4569-4602-9f4a-6ea40a57054f 13083 linux-dev julietta Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
808caa47-715e-4a8e-878b-e8921f0fbf2d 13110 linux-dev leota Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
6b892b8b-2438-4878-a2bf-df12643ddc0c 13114 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
e70b41b7-e0c2-4e8c-a78b-dc2f396b1f03 13123 linux-dev arlie Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
473d1e9f-5a63-42f6-b3e7-6cb552197641 13150 linux-dev arlie Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
c3c91294-71df-494a-a62a-12a801eb1471 13230 linux-dev julietta i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
c3d5263e-d419-4915-ae09-a80b55c42a6d 13231 linux-dev elli Hmm
3f59fc2b-d64c-459f-a1cb-2ca9230bc0ae 13233 linux-dev celsa good morning
484768dc-fcf9-4393-baad-30a966e24868 13236 linux-dev gertrud hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
c9f28e27-5cd7-409f-8bc4-6a53f27fabce 13244 linux-dev elli Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
d70fb1aa-a81a-4548-ac31-862eff99aabb 13255 linux-dev priscila Elli: A hacked version.
e1839700-216f-41e1-b214-7319f5fd6560 13261 linux-dev melda is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
b79f7f54-840b-4ad6-ab5f-15495b932de7 13265 linux-dev arlie Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
589a38da-9c90-4927-a57a-327d35c7079c 13266 linux-dev leota Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
61d543dc-330a-4ef0-877c-c413050eca34 13273 linux-dev melda so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
7c7ee425-1762-426f-b110-9fa1a38e6491 13278 linux-dev elli Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
064714b3-88fc-4794-8382-803cee468f83 13282 linux-dev melda vs just showing filename.jpg?
9958b09d-3989-4b2b-971f-f2f658eeb20d 13284 linux-dev elli And still the same behavious
28095c6f-cca5-4931-8bf6-7685c2eed828 13295 linux-dev priscila Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
2fa67880-9c20-48c7-84c6-0f49c6c75ea4 13297 linux-dev julietta Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
a5d40f9e-ac90-4177-bd25-3c30d8a167f1 13297 linux-dev jeanice Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
e513f329-4811-4803-a4fd-57a4a15a0248 13307 linux-dev priscila Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
4c0fc3a0-11ce-435e-987f-02fda2cf3c07 13308 linux-dev elli Ya
eb377746-6c75-476a-9769-debc31b63640 13360 linux-dev priscila Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
2064c82e-4d19-47ad-80a5-5778bd450ee9 13371 linux-dev arlie Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
1ef66015-9624-449e-ac22-63beefddea9a 13382 linux-dev leota Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
eee4fc5c-2029-4309-842d-2fb95fd1659b 13391 linux-dev melda godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
24024f07-ca2e-4e97-ada3-ab289b16bedf 13427 linux-dev jeanice Leota: fair enough
60fd8f2f-150a-4dfd-a2ba-fc0d6a911c45 13428 linux-dev priscila Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
a4f716b2-7cfd-4ed6-b2b8-ee42bcbd2707 13433 linux-dev elli Priscila, yeah
ed6492ab-592e-4716-aa3d-2822745955a9 13447 linux-dev felicia Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
df0c1ee3-a27f-4ce5-b269-52eccd4f9750 13455 linux-dev elli Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
61701c93-621d-4a6d-b707-be9c4928c69c 13455 linux-dev priscila Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
abd92dae-0d4b-449d-b612-230225f378bf 13461 linux-dev melda goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
635737a3-efe7-4725-b33b-e74480d1274d 13462 linux-dev leota Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
ad492924-45cc-4713-b906-2346923ad523 13466 linux-dev melda rather than reinstalling another system
98ac69ee-ec06-4182-a5cc-d35245ee0c99 13471 linux-dev priscila Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
4b489ca4-4081-4b3e-b399-bbcad4b8f99f 13498 linux-dev anya How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
6a5e4321-4861-4ec8-86dc-9cfa877e1ba5 13498 linux-dev melda so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
c011eee6-b17f-4c88-ba9c-632584f47aba 13500 linux-dev priscila Melda: sounds like you want find...
2f31ef06-094e-40c2-a54b-a8fea1830a49 13501 linux-dev felicia Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
e28e6f69-a80e-4385-8635-7d79e419f9bf 13510 linux-dev arlie Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
b8efc6b5-f7bc-4cf9-afe1-2898a168b504 13511 linux-dev julietta Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
b7fd101f-0e0a-4d65-a70a-72fb35a7c700 13527 linux-dev priscila Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
69e0d286-47a2-4090-bde7-34e89a96d072 13532 linux-dev julietta Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
3db39826-2607-4f98-9294-c37f854d427b 13561 linux-dev arlie Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
a08adc03-64cf-4929-b803-a4d869700a65 13568 linux-dev arlie Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
f6d986ad-60b1-49cb-b08b-9e182c3ab504 13574 linux-dev julietta yeah
d37d815b-0ba4-437a-9a81-be32d4d3464e 13585 linux-dev julietta well, how would i do that
1d25827d-8afc-44af-a581-f8107e49e999 13589 linux-dev julietta on application level ?
ef26b7c3-8c5c-45c8-9ea2-dc6f13f718d5 13597 linux-dev priscila Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
e5152d0c-5b16-4c8b-ad57-ce4bea6168b8 13599 linux-dev julietta like grab a handle to another apps socket
4984a860-cca0-473a-a13e-135e7dae41c8 13602 linux-dev elli Felicia, heh =P
a5bebc5e-50a8-4cae-a41e-075372701ccf 13609 linux-dev priscila Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
55de5a18-5b2a-4e4d-ad98-2dd1161ee033 13618 linux-dev priscila Melda: that will fsck up other things....
ab853d71-bc79-4289-b652-694bf5a4d5c1 13632 linux-dev abigail does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
854211f1-47f0-4231-95c4-4bbb0384bfd3 13634 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
1c315293-c308-4d22-ac05-22f1d58fe402 13653 linux-dev felicia i smiled or sure ;-)
9d55f070-8834-40ec-a042-deebbaf7cfa7 13659 linux-dev felicia er for*
c53d75bb-af26-462a-a3fe-8da47142fd2c 13676 linux-dev paulita http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
f499e800-32c2-4fe1-b548-6a0438469dda 13683 linux-dev elli Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
2be83676-0a18-4ad5-9692-f662ffa04533 13684 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
6b5a7806-c81a-4d70-a4e4-53ab580dab08 13693 linux-dev arlie pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
434b8fe2-1499-4c5d-9d77-b255a19b2764 13706 linux-dev julietta Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
35004d5f-824e-48c5-ba62-99826be3442b 13717 linux-dev arlie Julietta, use a proxy
cf8f2e06-c80f-42e7-b32b-24ea1190fb74 13719 linux-dev julietta well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
b4375bfd-ef7e-47f3-b0c5-24274b1bd4f8 13738 linux-dev felicia these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
adc29ec2-ad8f-4b7c-9b08-3fbe923e321f 13743 linux-dev elli haha
9986814d-6b43-4b32-9fe7-7ab37aab3855 13762 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
2d05f6ea-7a4d-4fc4-9e3b-c3e903c77f96 13796 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
b0ab9357-59a2-4865-b9a2-59d9f65ab72d 13803 linux-dev arlie Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
289f2d3b-e8a6-4636-b6f7-4ea976a68819 13842 linux-dev julietta hmm, yeah
812261ee-38e8-40e9-8761-8575d0a25cd5 13899 linux-dev arlie no thanks required, just send money
b76f9eca-37e3-4c92-9b86-7844ff32582d 13924 linux-dev laura Hello, when I open a file I see a bunch of ^M
3be66125-49cc-4e22-a217-a6237756237e 13930 linux-dev laura Is that bad in vi ?
4563611d-7ae7-4bbe-ab30-41520ffe0160 13973 linux-dev paulita wow dig this http://youtube.com/watch?v=nayarBrD6mk
f1b3692c-8428-47bf-8ea3-13e2cfd9d650 13979 linux-dev antonietta Laura: it means it uses dos eol
c4e60238-830e-4c7e-a6c2-d6923190d350 13985 linux-dev laura how do I remove those?
3331ede5-bf0a-4da6-8f80-b7dc5e68a2c3 14008 linux-dev laura i don't think it matters thou, cause It works
d6cc889b-deea-4748-8bd0-1c2f45f64b26 14033 linux-dev antonietta Laura: tr -d '\r' < file > newfile
2eb11295-2a8c-4c35-a8f4-e3b8b0434af0 14040 linux-dev elli Hmm, reinstalled PAM, no change..
8d018cb6-f343-433e-ab96-80e9d766ee1f 14075 linux-dev gale Laura: :%s/<ctrl-v then ctrl-m>//g in vim
123ff1dd-63bb-468e-821e-6e14196ec7de 14084 linux-dev madison Arlie: ey ey ey ey
45c0ef74-29c2-44f5-bc1a-e5a418fb6295 14134 linux-dev laura Gale: what is %s/
32998357-5362-42c0-a5dc-fcf96c0e9652 14142 linux-dev gale search and replace
a3fad84d-c726-487b-9c90-c3e1eee79bc3 14147 linux-dev laura I am don't use vi usually :/
e3ac6a8d-8963-4d5c-ac34-e3fedcc6a6fa 14148 linux-dev gale but actually
6f4ef3de-9c15-48b4-b3d6-be700d45ee40 14181 linux-dev gale you probably want the second set of // to be a linefeed instead
c445a3be-ff67-49bb-9537-aab4d0fa2fea 14282 linux-dev lonnie hi
f799a584-758c-4dcf-8898-57c8798f8ed6 14285 linux-dev gale Laura: you could use sed instead of course
b4341a9e-f12a-4895-b623-34681dc51550 14296 linux-dev lonnie how do i determine the graphics card from command prompt
529a8cfe-6f04-44ea-9faf-f3898bf06bd9 14306 linux-dev lonnie graphics card / ram / cpu speed etc
30dae95b-4970-4ba9-9480-2df8fb539a47 14328 linux-dev laura Gale: yea, but would like to learn VI though :)
c0faec71-62fa-402d-acef-3282b09e225c 14340 linux-dev granville hello
6f22c2ad-75b4-4799-9553-c750e4dcaef9 14372 linux-dev gale Laura: you might also consider vim-gtk until you get proficient with vim
1d1bade2-cfbe-4e3f-8827-4110524af51d 14380 linux-dev gale Laura: it's like the best of both worlds
ee2a0eb1-f7d2-4887-924e-719fa1dd91d3 14396 linux-dev angla ... unless you like emacs in kde
b37077f1-c62d-476d-8c91-df02f4061c52 14409 linux-dev laura There is a problem
311d7fb4-246b-4e91-8520-8abce906dd83 14415 linux-dev laura I opened a file in VI
03987a19-7129-40c0-bcd4-318d198c7181 14423 linux-dev laura Then I closed the terminal screen... now it says recover
0a3743ff-106f-46a8-932b-125c54d02871 14429 linux-dev laura So I open VI and type :recover
38e51e4a-13ad-43ae-9d4f-f8daec3f8b3a 14433 linux-dev laura Then :wq
39d96c59-85a7-4278-908e-7e3488113f50 14442 linux-dev laura Then when I reopen that file it still asks me to recover :s
161c73a1-299f-4878-b7e7-94b8c8e9f69d 14459 linux-dev laura so should I just delete the swap?
abfec540-b13d-4a6a-9d30-d95ba92f2f43 14472 linux-dev felicia Lonnie: lspci, and install and use hwinfo for more as well as cat /proc/cpuinfo
9b6f9dc3-b754-4bc2-872b-e366c38afbba 14473 linux-dev gale Laura: that can happen if say you openned it up again somewhere and edited it but the original occurance was still open
987f4a83-b934-4192-a78f-ae9a660d02f5 14492 linux-dev gale Laura: I would check it out first
697c1451-f2b5-491b-841e-3de40650756f 14502 linux-dev felicia Lonnie: lspci | grep VGA  for your video card
738dc639-7283-4fd1-926d-ea25d0d8d55a 14503 linux-dev laura how would I check it out? i closed the terminal screen withought closing vi
14cd8ed1-2bf9-47dd-8dae-b12aa0445b36 14529 linux-dev gale open again with vim
c38b75c8-1b13-471d-982b-dbd301ccfea2 14533 linux-dev arlie Madison, someone was in here earlier asking how to run mac osx on vmware ... i assued them of being you

d6e5cdb5-8621-4000-8e74-17dc93294fff 14566 linux-dev gale it's going to say that until you rm it iirc
158efe23-11c6-417a-a4f5-71fb8cb5bcc3 14571 linux-dev arlie Madison, i thought you were trying to offer an osx virtual host ;)
ebeae18f-e079-4210-825d-5da753d1ebdf 14571 linux-dev gale rm the swap file
ed93e2e2-fbcd-4b25-8875-5addbc05e1d4 14578 linux-dev madison lol
bc772dc8-b544-4ee8-a162-6955e1112397 14579 linux-dev laura okay
2e45efc8-440b-444d-80f9-241a52c12395 14581 linux-dev madison Arlie: naw
5f9446c7-2d00-4d85-8f9c-568c6b397c70 14586 linux-dev gale but make sure your main one is good first
