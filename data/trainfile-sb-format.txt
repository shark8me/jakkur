431b2c31-67c8-40ed-9d80-9ea94161a94c 7142 linux-dev meta Jermaine, RTM
ec1f9911-6998-43d6-9e48-9322106d9154 7148 linux-dev meta it tells you
02f750e4-c7d7-403e-abb7-bf6da20c13b4 7157 linux-dev jetta Santo: that requires running OS X
49b7ae82-a225-48c7-8d20-be57f2eba3cf 7169 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: If running as root, I need to set up a global config rather than ~/.fetchmailrc ?
bfefabce-49e9-4750-a630-521d55fcae3a 7173 linux-dev kathie Jermaine:  date '+%m%d%Y'
bf4c97a3-fc87-4e8d-b455-c1bba3e5aa02 7183 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: yup
3c1de433-dafa-48ec-8ac2-2067eb83e480 7190 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: I run it in daemon mode under my uid and it works very nicely

b2f81a57-c506-4b2a-9229-53c2deb41e2d 7200 linux-dev rachel pretty much put same info in global location.
5c57c09d-6457-40e8-93a7-8d6c5d094152 7215 linux-dev shanon epic5 is pretty cool...
b5beaa10-c987-4e60-a9cc-7040eaea0370 7236 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: OK thanks.. I'll try to find the docs on that.
2a37d722-4ddc-4262-b02e-33af9da4994f 7238 linux-dev elma hi folks
75badc7a-dc5c-4852-93d5-3a98a5e2529f 7260 linux-dev elma 'm sure i missed something but fonts rendering in my gimp works isn't at its best
d675f036-c041-49e5-b271-e3c60c06be82 7287 linux-dev elma is it because f the gimp or have i missed some tuning or such?
d82acec3-d5ea-4d47-8665-3fb1426a64e8 7288 linux-dev sena is there anyway to see what the CPU temperature is ?
d1e14ea7-7397-4579-ad20-ad12bd0a056d 7296 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: use "/etc/fetchmailrc"        -f <pathname> | --fetchmailrc <pathname>
dceebe23-77b1-462b-98b1-bb024b32f7f8 7297 linux-dev rachel Specify  a non-default name for the ~/.fetchmailrc run control file.
0ae09a73-f31f-47e0-9473-93cee98328f7 7312 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: in the man page http://fetchmail.berlios.de/fetchmail-man.html it doesn't mention any global fetchmailrc file... that is what was confusing me...
6d8856e4-030a-4f3c-ac03-5449d74ce0b6 7322 linux-dev thurman hi, do you have any recommendations for saving videos from a webcam in GNU/Linux?
72e2678b-c621-42d2-9586-f07111412391 7335 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
0ec7642b-b2e9-4690-b202-0a8a9d4f30b8 7341 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it.  And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)
77f97079-0c4c-452e-8fcc-2d611e3eeca4 7373 linux-dev meta Thurman, try motion
f08c070c-2170-4c8f-9610-e2708d6f12d2 7379 linux-dev rachel Malcolm: hmm
2a5af538-d087-47b7-8847-c60387aa0f50 7503 linux-dev thurman Meta: isn't it strange that it writes to /var/lib/motion/snapshots
87e41473-7dec-4e97-9854-bdaadde453d7 7511 linux-dev malcolm Rachel: ok my bad.. the /etc/init.d script exits automatically (and silently.. bitches) if no /etc/fetchmailrc exists
204768dd-347d-4b1e-8610-48f4353ccd99 7528 linux-dev malcolm have these people never heard of error messages?
1b6c1317-8454-41da-a9d3-486612f8e6a7 7533 linux-dev jesse Malcolm: it runs as user fetchmail here, and uses /etc/fetchmailrc
1d7e8f68-1d19-409d-b010-c31383e79b0f 7548 linux-dev malcolm Jesse: thanks

9d603126-449d-4701-8f4d-55feff17ac49 7573 linux-dev rachel Jesse++
b3156156-b659-4205-8849-6a38edf815a9 7638 linux-dev denny so how does one enforce a permission set and ownership set on a folder and all its children?

d9c75098-77a4-4274-a0b2-e96f7c35d39c 7783 linux-dev shenna hi, are sata drives accessed as sda or hda?
50e96624-f616-4244-893c-0b53d21f1464 7796 linux-dev elma sda
736c49da-41c2-482e-9ea9-e18bbec4c708 7860 linux-dev johnathon hey wat's up ?
0a2a3b71-f872-41bd-a9fe-8807c4aa68d0 7885 linux-dev shenna Elma: , then why is it that my 2.4 kernel recognises it as hda?
26aa87e4-5c94-48ee-aba8-872bdddab453 7898 linux-dev denny Elma, no I mean like always
8402d12b-d203-41d5-951f-0b2e64da1f6c 7904 linux-dev denny so if anything is added to that folder
15830662-f1ca-4634-9597-da12a1ce380b 7919 linux-dev denny the permission and ownership stays the same
f8218cb0-4904-49e8-938e-eb754fc0631d 7954 linux-dev denny throughout
4d3167f9-de2c-4d0e-ae9f-718fadaeecc0 7972 linux-dev latricia is there a way to tail -f a file and have that output piped to sed to have certain lines colorized?
a5b8eec9-62b0-4507-9a4d-fbec03340e00 8001 linux-dev malcolm Rachel / Jesse: should i put the "set daemon" option in /etc/fetchmailrc ? I'm guessing not
9dcd3007-14c4-4791-9b69-e260b7b41a36 8020 linux-dev shenna even dmesg says "hda:...."
4d94f503-9427-4309-815e-2773e6c76fb2 8025 linux-dev shenna why is it so?
d4e5f22e-832d-4b74-a0e1-627c1ca78632 8029 linux-dev elma bye folks

acad2137-a70c-4b67-be7b-fd336c675c83 8060 linux-dev shenna i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
d4b76dbe-746f-4b91-85f5-c840c571ce7f 8063 linux-dev melda Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?

e25cfad2-ebba-4d30-9b29-8f807e90589d 9150 linux-dev arlie gah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2896f76c-d91b-468e-9c99-71a17cfac3e6 9186 linux-dev shenna Arlie: what happened?
c0a2b78a-a7ab-4c20-a41c-1076fbebe12a 9200 linux-dev jetta I would like to make linux bootable on my intel mac mini.  Can anyone help me out with some info on getting around all the EFI nonsense?
4632f0a7-4ec7-4fb4-8e92-57cabd5f75e3 9214 linux-dev gale Shenna: yeah, I would go with 2.6.21 unless your distro is good about backporting security
bbb27036-d12d-4004-ad3d-5bea6adea330 9215 linux-dev arlie Shenna, another jerk wrote horrible code and unleashed it on the planet
efece5a3-5b6d-4394-b9c5-627ccfa5af5b 9245 linux-dev margene that was me sorry
1df84698-6645-43ac-82c4-91e5bb011638 9266 linux-dev shenna Gale: what do ou mean?
1bfd3b02-da45-4d88-93c3-e42e677ba308 9347 linux-dev gale Shenna: there's some security advisory up to version 2.6.20.8 afaik.  Guess what, if you use say 2.6.20.1, for instance, and your distro didn't address those vulnerabilities in their older version of the kernel, you're vulnerable.
f52381a3-9cfa-4dee-9ed7-0e26b52a26c5 9377 linux-dev shenna i downloaded the source today
8785146d-7f8f-4ff2-9f9e-ba88d45c77ce 9383 linux-dev margene the top distros usually do
16c3e7b2-c590-4d45-9c78-e9592c56152a 9390 linux-dev shenna so i guess it is the correct one

4603e203-28f9-4422-8720-3893ee8afc63 9589 linux-dev arlie Gale, but the OSS community rants endlessly about code quality that doesnt seem to exist

748fa700-5bdf-4693-ab26-4a1859b55fc6 9922 linux-dev margene I hope you used foul language
2526471a-d42e-407e-adfb-a7b4e077df05 9936 linux-dev arlie Margene, nah, but i did have 2 or 3 typos
8c63589c-7c08-450f-8f68-6d05d76a4d8c 10008 linux-dev margene too many goofy acronyms
c0ff9e03-d97e-49af-b895-e747877dcb60 10012 linux-dev jana is there an easy way on linux to see the current size of the TCP half-open connections queue, and the TCP accept queue?  (redhat specifically, but I'd be happier with something that works on most linuxes, rather than something redhat-specific)
3b0a0122-bf64-4a51-ba69-f43c341cc713 10058 linux-dev maegan I know it's not the leetest question in the word, but how do I remove those little bars that appear next to applets on the kde taskbar?
2d26241e-3332-49ba-aff0-ca25ba234db1 10059 linux-dev nicki have you poked around in /proc ?
5af470c4-fd99-44ec-9dcb-e71e6958a0cc 10077 linux-dev jana Nicki: I've been looking in /proc for a while but havne't found it
ab6b899d-8181-4302-9eb3-c294c6a3459e 10093 linux-dev jana also tried sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.tcp

4a533d0e-0609-4dc8-bb5b-90cd69d044e4 10100 linux-dev yuki does anyone run an ipv4 tunnel through ipv6 ?
997dbb21-918d-44d2-8e33-6e4e166c6c0e 10111 linux-dev jana they might be hiding in one of those, but I haven't found either one yet
f45197ce-4395-435f-a8b8-f349616520b1 10115 linux-dev yuki i'm trying to create my own hostname for irc
c18e4583-7e82-40d5-b224-a10195ab9034 10130 linux-dev margarette how can i do this: i want to protect some information, namely a PDF, i create pdfs with htmldoc, ive a webserver with php and mysql... i want a user to get the pdf and only be able to use it from the computer he got it in, how can i do that? i know its a very broad question but im not sure where else to ask... oh... and it has to run on linux, but the PDF will most likely be seen on windows but i dont know
9b375d4d-689a-48c0-a1c1-936b6df618d7 10190 linux-dev jana Margarette: your question is vague, I can't quite tell what you're asking, but at first pass it looks like the answer is "you can't".
1784de31-cccc-4976-bc3b-8cc60ac0175d 10198 linux-dev margene nothing should ever be seen on windows
8072e99c-be9f-4221-96ee-e62974ad7e87 10215 linux-dev margene except maybe a little devil gif flipping the bird

9669e491-6725-48aa-bd73-18c9d8471ddc 10387 linux-dev german Gale, for example ease of installing additional programs. Unless the program you're looking for is in the repository you have to go through the dependency hell manually

d756b795-2450-4556-8f7e-46a9be84677e 10469 linux-dev josef I'd put money on it but I don't think that's very freenode :P
a6270c8d-f1ab-4f70-8fe0-92616a27925c 10469 linux-dev gale German: ok, but each installation is like one more foot in the grave for it due to the dumbest thing every created -- the registry
12aa41f9-3b92-472d-aded-b3c0f082c89b 10485 linux-dev paulita well if your defending idiots Angla, then your one too.

910169d9-8d26-487e-8f78-fd7412aa05df 10531 linux-dev german Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery)
5dd1d05c-6e04-4605-9e8f-2e0bd33d9f93 10532 linux-dev margene yes, it's a bigger hype than usual

642a43b5-94d8-4272-b6c2-ab6a8ee748b7 10571 linux-dev gale German: I don't know all the details of gnome, but those are just text files that gconf uses
d9146d2f-88ac-40e6-a4a9-33fd1e23f556 10577 linux-dev paulita haha

3c2a4e7b-45a5-4160-a5cd-a39e2c7c6d33 10612 linux-dev german Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
e3bf1cf8-ec87-4a0e-9029-cf688b798040 10615 linux-dev gale German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them

fe1df310-1f0f-4c66-b093-80dc40319375 12027 linux-dev gale Ruthe: did you try /etc/init.d/networking restart?

51f23255-eef6-48b2-a5a6-600d5bd6c676 12127 linux-dev ruthe so at least Im sure he knows how to do that much
dcf81f98-e9f7-4a43-a278-88db70fdb8c7 12130 linux-dev angla is there another cable to try ?
a8563cc1-2507-40f4-bca7-3b7998e0511c 12141 linux-dev gale has he plugged in a power cable before though?
d307921d-6648-4fdb-acaf-e89afb9c68c2 12152 linux-dev ruthe there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?

9d5a8367-92a8-4ea5-91b3-f4ce844c80e0 12189 linux-dev ruthe Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on
7c7b87d7-297b-4070-81e9-5bc9add00576 12193 linux-dev angla Ruthe, trying as many possibilities as possible. it's *bound* to be something simple
7d0e03c5-7aa9-433b-9717-4946e3e5221f 12240 linux-dev renate Leota, what's new in it compared to 3.5.6? lol
909aa976-8ada-407b-99ae-96a1fc91dec1 12276 linux-dev gale Ruthe: did you make sure the network module is loaded?
32b3b3d0-50f5-4720-af3a-a58abf7d33ad 12281 linux-dev leota Renate: you get custom text colour for kicker, so you can have a black background in kicker with nice white text or whatever colour you want
132c8d47-49ed-4696-a1da-5ac16d862c7b 12295 linux-dev renate oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then
d2bec3fb-fca1-47c2-a781-486e9bceee2e 12299 linux-dev leota and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit
5f45aea1-0c9c-4596-8f91-364dbc95f325 12338 linux-dev margene the kicker is the kicker
ea135875-5056-4ba0-9981-2c0937a25590 12348 linux-dev angla Ruthe, if i were you, i'd make a list of possible reasons why. and then systematically try them out. i wouldn't go assuming anything
9367e18b-0182-4883-9332-4cd9e276e509 12377 linux-dev jeanice you need a custom kernel for kde?
aec0c9e2-5293-4050-b679-fbf033f1e481 12377 linux-dev gale yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
759d5163-b76e-43be-ac69-a2ee0454694a 12397 linux-dev gale best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
287b8372-faea-4941-a2fe-7c7053826d3a 12397 linux-dev leota Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
3796b06c-9b93-44da-971d-9f11c8698426 12418 linux-dev leota Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
0eccdca1-e019-4b46-8948-a1955003802c 12425 linux-dev margene I'll just wait for kde 4
6941f033-fa95-4c4e-9dea-a9e66157ab00 12427 linux-dev leota and i wanted initng
ea3dde41-79e3-4cbc-b3b4-8a498ef37fbd 12432 linux-dev leota Margene: long wait then...
c6c03edf-81c4-43b9-901e-9e350ae16659 12434 linux-dev margene till then I'll stick w/ xfce
f9f68c2b-8008-4181-9fe9-c22e934be7f2 12435 linux-dev angla the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
a22c7c55-8893-4a3d-97e6-5db688968bfc 12439 linux-dev renate KDE4 is vaporware...
ce5882dd-151f-4555-b008-c2b9036c15f4 12445 linux-dev jeanice Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
2e96c8a8-392f-428e-b86f-582295ab7626 12463 linux-dev margene indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
793fab05-1447-4b73-8457-68ba1ad3655f 12463 linux-dev santo Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware?  Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
35bf280b-ee3e-4dcc-ba26-fbfca4542c54 12476 linux-dev margene Santo, not go, but try it out
6d7fdab7-37ce-4b7d-b976-523cdb7ca62b 12481 linux-dev santo ah
cf8d62fd-b796-437f-b0c4-02a213ddd2b9 12499 linux-dev gale Angla: or like I always say, "
78b6789e-3457-4838-a0f9-2ca04def96cb 12511 linux-dev angla ?
e2d7c380-8bad-4bfb-9069-9e7a760efa83 12512 linux-dev margene the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
e0a4ad73-5bea-4070-8031-270db569ced8 12513 linux-dev gale When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
c3331012-d272-4173-947f-650f36c7265e 12523 linux-dev christina I have a question.  I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.
6025656a-c135-4f89-847c-af31629f1056 12537 linux-dev delmar has anyone used  Xcircuit ?  is that an app to draw and to test circiuts if theu work ?
58ee58e7-b8a0-43c7-82c9-abfb0f2c230d 12571 linux-dev angla Gale, a calm methodical approach to narrowing the search space, then you shoot the dog that chewed the cable ...
31885211-d95e-42f8-a442-df04883d19fa 12588 linux-dev margene for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
fb01a423-637d-4a21-99e6-7bdc07461fd0 12588 linux-dev leota Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
e4386030-c695-4900-8fd5-45a6724e9a2b 12598 linux-dev jeanice Leota: what went wrong?
dca1bfb0-e618-4fc3-a0aa-3bbf1f7fbd4d 12614 linux-dev leota Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
cd56c85e-077d-49db-ae4c-d0fe3e56ff17 12614 linux-dev gale yeah, being methodical is a big part
c7c4bbc0-294f-4ec7-8613-862f9ee5ea4b 12650 linux-dev jeanice Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
1a828046-5e80-4aa8-ad3a-115d5becf25e 12711 linux-dev renate I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
7348c255-eabc-42bf-8313-1e8ea852bc53 12719 linux-dev renate then again, d4x is kinda broken too
04a452f1-7291-4fff-8cc9-e8f99cbf465e 12735 linux-dev margene I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
1778ed4f-1639-4c09-9cdf-843ce7e7ecaf 12742 linux-dev leota Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
930f8763-ca4d-46c3-a2d0-1cdd739f4e52 12743 linux-dev margene nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
1687caff-6551-4637-b4fa-e6a631c52f8e 12766 linux-dev gertrud ok i have an ext3 image
21d1726f-01f1-48e8-9e8f-e9326584c584 12776 linux-dev renate Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
9d528bbe-5073-412b-9659-442e46f7aec7 12776 linux-dev gertrud i did not unmount it cleanly
52ed5aba-dfe5-4810-9e7b-f052ade628f6 12782 linux-dev renate Gertrud, fsck
eef364b5-d75e-43f4-819b-b38a44c4db63 12784 linux-dev gertrud is there a way to fsck an image?
6346c72f-d5ee-4748-8e79-789fdcb82cc3 12795 linux-dev gertrud it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
0acd7980-4b47-442e-9ce8-e00c9a0d6eba 12797 linux-dev margene archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
c846a78d-c29a-4b40-a99d-15020345c76c 12805 linux-dev jeanice Leota: what distro?
194f12a7-88a1-429a-a473-12f032c7414b 12813 linux-dev gertrud its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
d2041bdb-48d7-4302-bcd5-c2fc15d31a14 12818 linux-dev angla downthemall works for me
9ceed6ee-bcbf-4159-993d-6050a559ba9d 12831 linux-dev renate Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
accb0bfa-6d44-4017-bcf8-37dc9a01cc53 12841 linux-dev renate (scripting)
05ead0c4-87b1-42f0-8a70-a5bb34fda85e 12884 linux-dev margene well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms
0d43baef-7196-407a-8da7-93b0febe04a9 12907 linux-dev renate Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
0a3bdf84-f17d-46b5-a90f-ff73ef5a683b 12923 linux-dev margene no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
2907feb2-8b60-43a5-a5dc-56cc7dd8c38e 12934 linux-dev leota Jeanice: kubuntu
4f6bb504-21b0-4bf1-ac77-80412e8c831a 12949 linux-dev arlie posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
0cc4cd1d-1800-4558-9f4a-2b1eadaa5132 12956 linux-dev margene I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
c609eb1c-1964-4367-8d01-c2e483ee1402 12980 linux-dev julietta can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
3786a464-e62c-45e7-a1a6-b5562eceb9f3 13001 linux-dev arlie pcap injects ethernet packets
a07fe201-3672-4b3a-90ad-b7ea41612ddd 13004 linux-dev arlie so yes
feafafe0-81c5-4c2a-be5e-bfa49f88fc19 13010 linux-dev arlie they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
54460187-d004-4ac4-98a8-dd93f5017edd 13011 linux-dev renate Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
ee59555e-0fda-45ef-bdc3-270a116959e2 13022 linux-dev jeanice Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
53209385-b174-42c5-be1c-5e7191d47891 13026 linux-dev margene Renate, I dunno, it just happens
f1cf7667-0d6f-4d62-bd46-d568679a49db 13041 linux-dev renate magic, zomg! :o.O
b4c3af10-0c7b-4336-b6ca-06d3c3c344c9 13047 linux-dev margene you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
21d2e590-406f-44cd-af02-aed225d60372 13083 linux-dev julietta Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
e25b419c-3ff5-4a0e-8add-3a2f983cede4 13110 linux-dev leota Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
4f043003-e055-46cd-b808-831fc90a9d1f 13114 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
820302fa-b924-455c-abca-4a2912cfb446 13123 linux-dev arlie Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
fb0654e8-29ab-4fc7-8a11-245dc584284a 13150 linux-dev arlie Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
916c4935-8f65-4b5d-8e4e-0736e9e1d69d 13230 linux-dev julietta i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
a8142b5c-9234-47e4-9926-2c13c2b23767 13231 linux-dev elli Hmm
db4301b2-cc99-4852-8469-4a8db5b2467a 13233 linux-dev celsa good morning
e64842f6-6a1e-4ede-a947-863589f09ec7 13236 linux-dev gertrud hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
52c9b821-74c8-4097-970a-28bb86b77fed 13244 linux-dev elli Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
b0495f5b-c0bb-4343-9ee4-9dac4113cd20 13255 linux-dev priscila Elli: A hacked version.
42c6e199-aadd-438c-86cd-199f9d628743 13261 linux-dev melda is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
3e6b6584-1667-4bc9-bc84-20f82a04a09c 13265 linux-dev arlie Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
f20b3a5a-d10a-45d8-8a14-fa9ace342802 13266 linux-dev leota Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
07769c47-203e-4f4d-b185-634c456a39f5 13273 linux-dev melda so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
1291b66f-36d8-43f8-846a-003c4024ad2d 13278 linux-dev elli Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
f8fd55a1-311d-4871-8cf8-078d5308ee3d 13282 linux-dev melda vs just showing filename.jpg?
ede96905-ad60-4899-8168-8e4ef86828db 13284 linux-dev elli And still the same behavious
8c899f2d-b204-4a90-9027-3107c2aee13d 13295 linux-dev priscila Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
59fc33e9-f67a-487e-ad55-a532c843ff95 13297 linux-dev julietta Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
33539870-21ad-4e21-a6fd-18ee70d1bc6b 13297 linux-dev jeanice Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
094ec51a-69f4-443f-9025-aac4dc0b5fc7 13307 linux-dev priscila Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
530fc765-1943-40cf-9c49-614c6404e74e 13308 linux-dev elli Ya
add04efc-f127-438a-8ac7-23137ebd2c21 13360 linux-dev priscila Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
52e106fe-1865-48f0-9bc1-4de7154c3396 13371 linux-dev arlie Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
58f91baf-a536-4be2-bd01-4e3ca9b24517 13382 linux-dev leota Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
7a6df2b3-2002-4167-ab4e-cc918e4f7711 13391 linux-dev melda godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
2feed27d-7eb6-4709-932d-07150d569980 13427 linux-dev jeanice Leota: fair enough
7fa11422-3ca5-4e69-8161-c4662b688e7c 13428 linux-dev priscila Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
44c603c3-edbf-43d2-9b7c-65e65c479514 13433 linux-dev elli Priscila, yeah
9dfad878-7663-433b-87a3-4e1301524c76 13447 linux-dev felicia Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
78f932ad-07b8-456c-b748-44505e8ea9e0 13455 linux-dev elli Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
63a0cf1f-c032-40d6-aac0-1db30dc7be35 13455 linux-dev priscila Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
5d786ee5-2a5d-42c5-bafc-811abd8c4598 13461 linux-dev melda goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
7ce160a3-d5a1-40b8-9da4-aa2c2c4f202a 13462 linux-dev leota Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
a5f1d36a-1fbe-4a4a-8fc8-e81e5afe841e 13466 linux-dev melda rather than reinstalling another system
9c9333ab-32d4-4de9-95f3-509e949bc966 13471 linux-dev priscila Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
648a5c9f-c7b0-4089-a985-36d55293a411 13498 linux-dev anya How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
054be679-ac62-4082-afc1-924245a953a4 13498 linux-dev melda so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
6174d82d-883b-4936-8859-4fb52ef1f908 13500 linux-dev priscila Melda: sounds like you want find...
acc1b038-ab26-4ae3-bba9-28007cb53a46 13501 linux-dev felicia Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
a8f38bd3-d23e-4608-949c-e3f0db4ab7ec 13510 linux-dev arlie Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
56308a36-12ea-445e-b455-d70528a50ad8 13511 linux-dev julietta Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
dfa18c96-ac42-48e2-8226-4b84d55b1d52 13527 linux-dev priscila Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
17715c83-2718-4f57-8159-a6b4579f3a70 13532 linux-dev julietta Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
28aa9fdf-70b6-4331-9b01-ba51521812d1 13561 linux-dev arlie Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
00f7d205-0b42-47b1-9115-1351d8331dbd 13568 linux-dev arlie Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
8cb61c14-d264-4151-8b14-4a73384ece5c 13574 linux-dev julietta yeah
37bcc28c-b953-48a2-a6e9-323141dd8883 13585 linux-dev julietta well, how would i do that
197aa52b-ea0f-43e2-bbab-44ab9ff75244 13589 linux-dev julietta on application level ?
393d6bac-f982-424d-9899-55efb7bf7676 13597 linux-dev priscila Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
9b09cd0e-f6bc-41e6-bc30-5fa4df018f44 13599 linux-dev julietta like grab a handle to another apps socket
53b86195-efba-4514-a3d9-82e7691fbe82 13602 linux-dev elli Felicia, heh =P
2bda9281-0039-4a7e-acad-26f065accfb9 13609 linux-dev priscila Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
8f9925e8-df2a-4a57-ab95-8812c88a34c5 13618 linux-dev priscila Melda: that will fsck up other things....
3f3199d8-4e51-4769-a74a-2a9d2958e177 13632 linux-dev abigail does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
b8b613f2-ce1b-4054-af82-9106f97f1b02 13634 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
ce6dd167-2090-4534-9cd3-22ea43bd42b5 13653 linux-dev felicia i smiled or sure ;-)
88da72b4-6f7b-442d-824a-812933a95b8a 13659 linux-dev felicia er for*
ba3296e1-4b6e-40cf-b05d-432c1cfbfb84 13676 linux-dev paulita http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
c8ae4b30-c629-434b-a701-23d3e70cd7ad 13683 linux-dev elli Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
b226f843-5ff0-4ef9-8e8a-fb448b8c428f 13684 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
5effd818-e9a4-42f4-baa0-9de67ced8d67 13693 linux-dev arlie pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
a673bd20-8200-492b-8839-89c4567cc49d 13706 linux-dev julietta Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
4a46f34b-ef1b-4c0e-8044-cb794e7a5524 13717 linux-dev arlie Julietta, use a proxy
f931d1c0-162e-4739-b1da-5af67ad936b7 13719 linux-dev julietta well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
7a524ed9-5a51-4bca-a858-39bc9718e98f 13738 linux-dev felicia these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
99359e0b-78c8-471f-a76a-8de09322d10f 13743 linux-dev elli haha
a8c3546a-181a-4859-9b2d-b5a976c1edf7 13762 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
511748c2-94a4-43e2-b04e-1208d589aae8 13796 linux-dev arlie Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
8810164d-b674-4d49-b3cb-0e6b0426cdd5 13803 linux-dev arlie Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
7b96badf-7c6f-4e72-9476-b223628d6307 13842 linux-dev julietta hmm, yeah
8925e751-9921-4863-afd3-f7b49e1c1338 13899 linux-dev arlie no thanks required, just send money
ddf2fa34-dcec-465e-8783-9ff560adf6a2 13924 linux-dev laura Hello, when I open a file I see a bunch of ^M
3e202f11-9f8c-4d9b-affa-90b606cf19c8 13930 linux-dev laura Is that bad in vi ?
4e20d516-63f9-4bf6-bb80-47ae23077173 13973 linux-dev paulita wow dig this http://youtube.com/watch?v=nayarBrD6mk
8902cd21-0a64-454b-ac2a-4a7d905a01ff 13979 linux-dev antonietta Laura: it means it uses dos eol
d19d186f-32b5-4418-abbb-3b0ed2b3de85 13985 linux-dev laura how do I remove those?
045faa1d-73c3-4176-a602-5227ca75a0cd 14008 linux-dev laura i don't think it matters thou, cause It works
68da1147-bab1-4a49-9e14-f6ca29fd57c6 14033 linux-dev antonietta Laura: tr -d '\r' < file > newfile
fa2462e8-a7bb-4d86-bb86-4fbf43932433 14040 linux-dev elli Hmm, reinstalled PAM, no change..
cdd4a658-5041-43c3-a486-d3ce8f15dfbf 14075 linux-dev gale Laura: :%s/<ctrl-v then ctrl-m>//g in vim
814bd195-bb98-45f7-a053-c136fc94f6a1 14084 linux-dev madison Arlie: ey ey ey ey
8964f88f-0fe2-4df6-aa03-05f867abb909 14134 linux-dev laura Gale: what is %s/
0a236ca0-1d40-4985-a354-a038bdadf7e9 14142 linux-dev gale search and replace
8a6fe066-4ad1-49a0-bd78-9356b465f491 14147 linux-dev laura I am don't use vi usually :/
3738c329-42d4-4856-a2f3-54b616bc0e56 14148 linux-dev gale but actually
286277d4-110c-4f76-b425-05190b2b69ac 14181 linux-dev gale you probably want the second set of // to be a linefeed instead
e37cabab-f03a-4819-808e-3c72f102ab37 14282 linux-dev lonnie hi
a5432a87-0ffa-470d-92fb-52a885b365a9 14285 linux-dev gale Laura: you could use sed instead of course
ebb438a6-89fc-41af-a05a-fe5a16fa9a77 14296 linux-dev lonnie how do i determine the graphics card from command prompt
f7d6e2f1-d4e8-45ae-93e8-87293049bca4 14306 linux-dev lonnie graphics card / ram / cpu speed etc
73ecdcff-46ab-459e-91d8-eaea9dbecc73 14328 linux-dev laura Gale: yea, but would like to learn VI though :)
2961645e-3b1e-49a5-a4e4-2caf22351cec 14340 linux-dev granville hello
3bc665df-d5bd-4dd7-b6fd-34d4ce9498ee 14372 linux-dev gale Laura: you might also consider vim-gtk until you get proficient with vim
773c8779-73c4-44a3-a8d0-5010c2d15e52 14380 linux-dev gale Laura: it's like the best of both worlds
10ebc60d-d84d-44d7-888e-5eaa9f3d8714 14396 linux-dev angla ... unless you like emacs in kde
8604ab7b-2ff1-4e96-a240-aa0fe4f86c3d 14409 linux-dev laura There is a problem
a6bfbfd2-1694-4f0a-8dbb-374fba93166e 14415 linux-dev laura I opened a file in VI
f98108f9-f04b-4338-99cc-7887233a7ebc 14423 linux-dev laura Then I closed the terminal screen... now it says recover
56bd68ec-28e7-4f25-a194-cf0c5f92159f 14429 linux-dev laura So I open VI and type :recover
97587bbf-d720-4657-b047-0fabc75deb0e 14433 linux-dev laura Then :wq
681748cf-96dd-4b92-bd78-1c446f4be974 14442 linux-dev laura Then when I reopen that file it still asks me to recover :s
ae13cbfb-d9f5-482a-9e72-ce75916bfc8e 14459 linux-dev laura so should I just delete the swap?
642e0bd4-04db-4ae7-9459-f36f4033bf88 14472 linux-dev felicia Lonnie: lspci, and install and use hwinfo for more as well as cat /proc/cpuinfo
a176eef8-e799-4a84-aeac-bdca0ce394f1 14473 linux-dev gale Laura: that can happen if say you openned it up again somewhere and edited it but the original occurance was still open
2ec84cf5-b15c-45ab-a705-c0593b12f61b 14492 linux-dev gale Laura: I would check it out first
a4b9833b-1c80-4a88-96af-46a11cf0c6f6 14502 linux-dev felicia Lonnie: lspci | grep VGA  for your video card
9b5474e6-d495-492e-858d-a3f1c874bccd 14503 linux-dev laura how would I check it out? i closed the terminal screen withought closing vi
d2940747-223b-452b-a911-6f35f39cbc30 14529 linux-dev gale open again with vim
11cf951c-72c3-4d61-bc7f-87452d39978a 14533 linux-dev arlie Madison, someone was in here earlier asking how to run mac osx on vmware ... i assued them of being you
a504dfee-09c4-45de-b936-f90fa8def9a1 14548 linux-dev madison wtf?

ef1ed8d3-830b-4d9b-a771-e31c0bb84a67 14566 linux-dev gale it's going to say that until you rm it iirc
e50c2d6e-e9cc-496a-96fd-8891919317b5 14571 linux-dev arlie Madison, i thought you were trying to offer an osx virtual host ;)
34c1281b-9dd9-4e22-af18-86c0c8d6df71 14571 linux-dev gale rm the swap file
b07a9b9f-cb69-4c41-a2a9-b680840c030f 14578 linux-dev madison lol
b034fd6e-198b-46c9-bdfb-c1edb7cb1220 14579 linux-dev laura okay
